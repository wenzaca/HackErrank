# Hackerrank Coding Challenge in Java
This project contains my resolution to the challenges from Hackerrank. All the challenges have been done in Java, mainly focused on using Java 8. I have been done the challenges to help me to be prepared for Java Technical interviews.

The challenges are available in [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) website.

Fell free to reach me out with better solutions. I would love to get mine improved.

The classes may have junit 4 for testing. Asserts have been used as well.
